Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a Player vs Player (PvP) Tic Tac Toe game developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by Musiab Mir.

Description
Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
If all 9 squares are filled and no player achieves a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
